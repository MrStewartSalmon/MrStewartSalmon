Stewart Salmon
Aspiring AWS Solutions Architect | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner |

Hello! I'm Stewart Salmon, a passionate and dedicated learner on a journey to become an AWS Solutions Architect. With a strong foundation in cloud computing, I have successfully earned my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and am currently preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect certification exam.

By day, I work full-time as a property sourcer, a role that demands keen analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to manage complex projects. By night (and any other spare moment), I immerse myself in the world of AWS, enhancing my skills and knowledge in cloud computing.

Balancing a full-time job with part-time studies can be challenging, but my commitment to professional growth and my enthusiasm for cloud technologies keep me motivated. Through my GitHub repository, I aim to share my learning journey, contribute to open-source projects, and connect with like-minded professionals in the tech community.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas. Let's build something amazing together!
